# rumRaisin  
### About
rumRaisin is a vulnerable web platform. I joined some CTF(Capture The Flag) games and collected some interesting challenges, So I create this project to share those ideas. And it will update irregularly.  
### How to use  
It needs PHP+MySQL environment. If you are using a Debian based Linux distribution, you will need to install the following packages  
`apt-get install apache2 mysql-server php5 php5-mysql php5-gd libapache2-mod-php5`  
To set up the rumRaisin database, change the variables in config and visit install.php. Then you can enjoy :)  
### Warning  
Do not upload it to your public Internet facing servers.It is dangerous.
