# rumRaisin  
rumRaisin is a vulnerable web platform.I joined some CTF(Capture The Flag) games and collected some interesting challenges,So I create this project to share.  

----  
###How to use  
It needs PHP+MySQL environment. If you are using a Debian based Linux distribution, you will need to install the following packages  
`apt-get install apache2 mysql-server php5 php5-mysql php5-gd`  
To set up the rumRaisin database, change the variables in config and visit install.php. Then you can enjoy :)  
###Warning  
Do not upload it to your public Internet facing servers.It is dangerous.
